# Kokborok Digitalisation Project

The **Kokborok Digitalisation Project** is an initiative to curate and enhance parallel data for the Kokborok-English language pair. This project builds upon the SMOL dataset by Google, available on Hugging Face, and involves modifying and correcting it to better reflect the nuances of the local Kokborok dialect.

## From the Author  

> *"Language is a living, breathing entity—constantly evolving, shaping cultures, and connecting generations. When we digitally preserve and document it, we don’t just safeguard words; we ignite progress, making knowledge more accessible and enriching for all."*  

— ***Dr. Sudhamoy Debbarma***  


 


## Overview

- **Objective:** To collect, modify, and enhance data from various sources to create a high-quality, parallel dataset for the Kokborok-English language pair.
- **Dataset Origin:** The dataset is derived from the SMOL dataset, which provides professionally translated data for 115 under-represented languages. This project adapts that dataset to serve the needs of the Kokborok-speaking community.

## Dataset

- The dataset consists of parallel translations in **Kokborok-English**.
- It is a curated and improved version of the **SMOL dataset**.
- Data corrections are based on local linguistic expertise and dialectal accuracy.

## Usage

- The dataset can be used for **machine translation**, **linguistic research**, and **language preservation efforts**.
- Specific instructions on how to access or download the dataset will be added soon.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to contribute corrections or additional data, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
